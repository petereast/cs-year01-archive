CE154 Assignment Marking Scheme 2016-17
---------------------------------------

Section 1: Layout and CSS

[x] 05  1. The site has menus across the top and down the side.
[x] 05  2. There are consistent menus across all pages of the site.
[x] 05  3. CSS has been used for the layout.
[x] 05  4. The HTML of the pages validates as HTML5:
           https://validator.w3.org/nu/
[x] 05  5. The CSS of the pages validates: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
           (HTML/CSS validation also directly available through Mozilla)

Section 2: Structure and Merchandise

[x] 05  6. The site has a home page, a user login page, a manager login page and
           one page each for Books, CDs, Games and DVDs.
[x] 05  7. There are at least six items for sale in each category, i.e. Books,
           Music, Games and DVDs, each shown with a unique item code, a short
           description, an image, a price and a number in stock.
[x] 05  8. Each item for sale has a different picture which relates specifically
           to the item.
[x] 05  9. The database tables are used dynamically to create the pages of items
           for sale on the website. In other words, the items are not hard coded
           in an HTML page; instead, the HTML page is created dynamically from
           a .jsp page by consulting the database whenever that .jsp is loaded.

Section 3: Customer Logon and Purchase

[x] 05 10. The user can log in to the site and log off again using their
           customer_number and passwd from the customer table in the database.
           Specifically, user 1001 can log in with password 'mollie' and this is
           checked by searching the database.
[x] 05 11. There is Javascript validation of login information. It should check
           that username is a number and that the password submitted is not
           null.
[x] 05 12. The user can 'purchase' an item which is for sale, but only when
           logged in. No 'shopping cart' or payment needed, just click on a
           button called 'Buy' which is next to an item. We will then go to a
           purchase page. The user can then click 'Complete Purchase' whereupon
           the item is purchased immediately as long as the user is logged
           in. Otherwise, it can say 'not logged in' or similar. The value
           field of the order_item is the same as the item_price for the item
           in the inventory, unless there is a discount (see below).
[x] 05 13. On the purchase page there is a box to enter a promotional code. If
           the user enters a code in the box, it is looked up in the
           promotion_code table and the appropriate discount applied
           when 'Complete Purchase' is clicked. A discount of 10 means the cost
           is reduced by 10%. Invalid codes do not result in
           a discount! This feature will be verified by looking at the value
           field for the order_item created when the item is purchased.
[x] 05 14. Stock goes down when an item is purchased. This will be verified by a
           customer making a purchase and observing if the stock count goes
           down. 
[x] 05 15. An item which is out of stock may not be purchased. This will be
           verified by a customer clicking Buy against an item which shows a
           stock count of zero. The system should give an error message and not
           purchase the item for the customer.

Section 6: Customer Review and Search

[x] 05 16. Next to an item for sale is a Review button. If a logged-on user
           clicks that button they can enter a simple 1-5 integer
           rating using radio buttons. The review rating is recorded in
           the 'review' database table, which can be viewed from the manager
           page.
[x] 05 17. There is a search box at the top of the screen. If a string is
           entered, this will display all items in the database (of whatever
           type) which contain the entered string in their item description
           field. For example, if you enter "playing", the album Netsky will be
           displayed.

Section 4: Manager Logon and Review

[x] 05 18. The manager can log on to the site. Specifically, manager_number 100
           can log in with passwd 'luigia', and this is checked in the database.
[x] 05 19. The manager can view the contents of all the database tables but only
           when logged in.
[x] 05 20. For a new order, a delivery date three days in the future is recorded
           in the database. This will be checked by ordering an item and then
           from the manager page looking for one new entry in the customer_order
           table and one new entry in the order_item table. (We assume a
           customer always orders one item only and there is one customer_order
           and one order_item for that item.)
